## Usage

> Tarot Journal will walk you through an 8 card Tarot reading based on "The Crow Tarot" by MJ Cullinane. Simply follow the instructions to complete your reading. *__Since this app is currently being developed, knowledge of the Tarot is required. [Biddy Tarot](https://www.biddytarot.com/) is a great place to start learning the Tarot if you are new.__*

## Requirements

- Node 10.2.1 or higher
- NPM 5.6.0 or higher

## Features

The features of this app are very simple:

1. You can see which positions have which meaning.
1. You can select a card from the deck by typing.
1. You can see which card you have pulled for each position.

## Roadmap

- Unit Testing.
- Integration Testing.
- Since the app is currently pretty monolithic, I'd like to break it down into modules.
- As a user, I would like to see this as a web app.
- As a user, I would like a prettier text interface. (maybe use [this](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#layouts))
- As a user, I would like to be able to save whether the card is upright or inverse.
- As a user, I would like to see a traditional description of the card pulled.
- As a user, I would like to see instructions on how to begin.
- As a user, I would like to see that I cannot select the same card twice.
- As a user, I would like to be able to download and update the app via NPM.
